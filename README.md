### Description:
Cub3D is a 3D horror RPG game designed using raycasting, within which we developed our own rasterizer to incorporate custom 3D models into the game.

## Features:

- **Raycaster:** The walls are rendered using an optimised 3D ray casting algorithm.
- **3D Models:** The in-game objects are rendered using a homemade rasterizer.
- **Particles:** The particles are rendered as billboard images and collide with the walls.
- **Ennemy AI:** Each enemies have their own custom AI that interact with the player.
- **Collisions:** There are collisions between every object in the world: enemies, walls, items...
- **User Interface:** There is a custom user interface that handle interactive sliders, clickable button, and text.
- **OBJ parsing:** There is a homemade ".obj" parser.
- **Map loading:** You can load custom ".cub" files.
- **Procedural Generation:** The game generates doors, items and enemies procedurally in the map.
